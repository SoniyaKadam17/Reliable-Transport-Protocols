# Reliable-Transport-Protocols
objective of this project is to design, test, and implement three reliable data transport protocols: Alternating-Bit (ABT), Go-Back-N (GBN), and Selective-Repeat (SR). We need to implement the three reliable data transfer protocols within the given simulator by writing C code that compiles under the GCC environment, ensuring compatibility and correct operation on a designated host that we can ssh into. The tasks involve creating sending and receiving transport-layer code for these protocols that will execute in a simulated hardware/software environment. The programming interface provided to our routines is closely aligned with that in a UNIX environment; the code should call our entities from above and from below implementing the simulated timers to start and stop and timer interrupts will cause our timer handling routine to be activated. The goal is to develop a reliable data transfer mechanism, ensuring accurate and in-order data delivery under network conditions like packet loss and corruption, emulated in the simulated environment.
